# static variable can be modified only and only by using cls variable or class name . 
self and object reference can't be used to modify the static variable
static variable can be moified anywhere within the class or outside the class by using class name.
But inside the class methods we can also use cls variable.

Inside the constructor  -------- class name
Inside the instance method  -------- class name
Inside the class method   -------- class name and cls
Inside the static method  -------- class name
Outside of the class     -------- class name
